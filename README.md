# OneWire
Just for fun another library for the time being for AVR Atmega 328.

The goal of this library is to provide more then one 1-Wire interface. So you can seperate diffrent networks of 1-Wire devices.
It will also support other devices like battery monitoring, eeprom, humitidy monitor and so one.

Different classes are included for specific device to simplify access to function on a special device.
